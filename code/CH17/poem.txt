The Yangs:          No silk thread can string these pearls;
                   Dim now the tear-stains of those bygone years;
                   A thousand bamboos grow before my window--- 
                   Is each dappled and stained with tears?
Hawkes:            Yet silk preserves but ill the Naiad's tears:
                   Each salty trace of them fast disappears.
                   Only the speckled bamboo stems that grow
                   Outside the window still her tear-marks show. 
The Yangs:                      Xi Shi
                    Gone with the foam the beauty who felled cities,
             Her longing for home in Wu's palace an empty dream,
             Laugh not at the East Village girl who aped her ways,
             White- haired, she still washed clothes beside the stream.
Hawkes:                        Xi Shi
            That kingdom-quelling beauty dissolved like the flower of foam, 
            In the foreign palace, Xi Shi, did you yearn for your old home?
            Who laughs at your ugly neighbour with her frown-and-simper now,
            Still steeping her yarn at the brook-side, and the hair snow-white on her brow?
